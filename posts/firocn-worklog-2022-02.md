## Twitter

[@firo_cn](https://twitter.com/firo_cn) Twitter feed is now live. The current operating strategy is to routinely retweet official tweets and post translated articles, hoping to explore more of the Chinese community's own content in the future.

The [first event](https://twitter.com/firo_cn/status/1493799682048655363) of @firo_cn was held in February with the aim of attracting follower growth. The effect is not very obvious with 131 followers at the moment, so we will have to explore more ways to grow followers in the future.

## Website

The [firocn.org](https://firocn.org/) website is now officially online. The server is located in Hong Kong, both domestic and international access are very fast. The website is static pages generated using Node.js, clean, pure and efficient, easy to maintain.

If we need to access the back-end server in the future, we will consider a complete front-end and back-end separation, where the front-end is still pure static pages and the back-end interfaces are accessed from the browser. I hope in the future we can develop some fun things.
